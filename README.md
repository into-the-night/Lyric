# Lyric

Lyric is a simple discord music bot made in python using yt-dlp and discord.py API
You can use it play music from Youtube videos.

NOTE: As the bot uses yt-dlp, the .webm files are first downloaded and then streamed into voice. The bot deletes every .webm file in its directory when the leave command is executed. 
And also, this program utilizes ffmpeg. For windows devices, ffmpeg.exe is recommended.
